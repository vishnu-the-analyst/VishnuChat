        "This is my first personal project since my master's thesis. I have decided to create a personal chat bot based on my whatsapp chat history. Though I thought creating such bot would be super difficult, after some research and learning I learned that it is very easy to create a basic bot which can provide funny responses. Python has a wonderful library called [chatterbot](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which offers a complete package to create such bot. Since this library is not language based the chat language doesn't matter. As I am bilingual, most of my chats involve both English and [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) words."
