# **Wall-E Bot**

### *19/02/2023*

This is my first personal project since my master's thesis. I have decided to create a personal chat bot based on my whatsapp chat history. Though I thought creating such bot would be super difficult, after some research and learning I learned that it is very easy to create a basic bot which can provide funny responses. Python has a wonderful library called [chatterbot](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which offers a complete package to create such bot. Since this library is not language based the chat language doesn't matter. As I am bilingual, most of my chats involve both English and [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) words.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz
```

## Usage

Make a copy of this [colab] file and run the blocks to create your own chatbot in two steps.
